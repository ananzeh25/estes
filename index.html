                        I typically make the drive in 90 minutes to 2 hours depending on traffic and weather. From DIA airport, it's about 2 hours. I always build in extra time during peak summer weekends and winter weather to ensure you arrive safely and on schedule for your plans.

                        Yes, I'm experienced with Colorado mountain winter driving. I've navigated countless snowy trips safely. However, if conditions become dangerous, I'll let you know and we can reschedule. Your safety always comes first before any booking or schedule.

                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        September and October during rutting season offer the most spectacular elk viewing. Early morning and evening provide the best chances. I know the prime viewing locations around town and in Moraine Park where hundreds of elk gather annually.

                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Yes, during peak season (late May through October), Rocky Mountain National Park requires timed entry permits. You'll need to book those separately at recreation.gov. I recommend getting permits before booking your ride to ensure everything aligns perfectly.
